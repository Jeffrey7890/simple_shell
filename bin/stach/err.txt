E2BIG  The total number of bytes in the environment (envp) and argument list (argv) is too large.

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix of pathname or the name of a script interpreter.  (See also path_reso‐
              lution(7).)

       EACCES The file or a script interpreter is not a regular file.

       EACCES Execute permission is denied for the file or a script or ELF interpreter.

       EACCES The filesystem is mounted noexec.

       EAGAIN (since Linux 3.1)
              Having changed its real UID using one of the set*uid() calls, the caller was—and is now still—above its RLIMIT_NPROC resource  limit
              (see setrlimit(2)).  For a more detailed explanation of this error, see NOTES.

       EFAULT pathname or one of the pointers in the vectors argv or envp points outside your accessible address space.

       EINVAL An ELF executable had more than one PT_INTERP segment (i.e., tried to name more than one interpreter).

       EIO    An I/O error occurred.

       EISDIR An ELF interpreter was a directory.

ELIBBAD
              An ELF interpreter was not in a recognized format.

       ELOOP  Too  many  symbolic  links  were  encountered in resolving
              pathname or the name of a script or ELF interpreter.

       ELOOP  The maximum recursion limit was reached  during  recursive
              script  interpretation (see "Interpreter scripts", above).
              Before Linux 3.8, the error produced  for  this  case  was
              ENOEXEC.

       EMFILE The  per-process limit on the number of open file descrip‐
              tors has been reached.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              pathname is too long.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number  of  open  files
              has been reached.

       ENOENT The  file pathname or a script or ELF interpreter does not
              exist.

       ENOEXEC
              An executable is not in a recognized format,  is  for  the
              wrong  architecture,  or  has some other format error that
              means it cannot be executed.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix of pathname or a script  or
              ELF interpreter is not a directory.

       EPERM  The  filesystem is mounted nosuid, the user is not the su‐
              peruser, and the file has the set-user-ID or  set-group-ID
              bit set.

       EPERM  The process is being traced, the user is not the superuser
              and the file has the set-user-ID or set-group-ID bit set.

       EPERM  A "capability-dumb" applications would not obtain the full
              set  of  permitted  capabilities granted by the executable
              file.  See capabilities(7).

       ETXTBSY
              The specified executable was open for writing  by  one  or
              more processes.
